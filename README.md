This repository has as its main content everything related to the development of the HOLLOW WIKI project on the front-end side, it has all the rendering and requests that an end user can make. It has a responsive design, side navigation and three interactive main pages:

  - The first page (HOME), aims to show the characters and their information. In the event that the user has an account created in the application, they can add them as favorites.

  - On the second page (PROFILE), you can see the items marked as favorites and be unmarked by the same user. In the same profile section the user can change their basic information, change the background style of the page and log out... but in the computer version the user can play a minigame that will help them unlock profile photos and have a player with original Hollow Knight music.

  - A third page (ADMIN), can be seen if the user has an admin account and this part of the application is intended to perform admin actions, such as creating, editing and deleting characters from the database.
